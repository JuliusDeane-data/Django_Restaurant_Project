# My Restaurant App

This repository contains a simple web application built with **Django** and **Bootstrap 5**, designed to showcase basic restaurant menu functionality.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project primarily serves as a **learning and practice exercise** for Django web development. It's built upon concepts taught in a Udemy course. Therefore, the application focuses on demonstrating core Django features and fundamental web development principles, rather than providing a comprehensive, production-ready solution. It's intended more as a **portfolio piece** to illustrate skills in Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The application currently allows users to browse a menu of meals and add them to their cart (login required for adding meals).
They can also contact the restaurant via contact form.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Currently Implemented)

* **Meal Display:** View various meal items with their names, prices, and stock information.
* **User Login/Logout:** Users can register, log in, and log out to access certain features.
* **Order Functionality:** Authenticated users can "order" meals (simple click, no actual order processing yet).
* **Contact Form:** A basic contact form for users to send messages.
* **Responsive Design:** Basic responsiveness using Bootstrap 5.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

* **Django:** Web framework for the backend logic.
* **Python:** Programming language.
* **HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
* **Bootstrap 5:** For responsive design and UI components.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

I plan to add the following features and improvements:

* **Shopping Cart Management:** Implement functionality to remove items from the shopping cart.
* **Order Submission:** Develop a full order submission process.
* **Bug Fixing & Refinements:** Address any existing display issues or bugs for a smoother user experience.
* **Contact Form Styling:** Visually enhance the contact form for better aesthetics and usability.
